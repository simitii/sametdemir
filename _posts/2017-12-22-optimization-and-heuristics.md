  As software developers, we are interested in optimization for most of the time. However, there is a trick which is avoiding over-optimization. Here comes the heuristics. Heuristic simply means something experience and general logic say without calculation. When it comes to real life, we, human beings, often act using heuristics and optimization comes in when we are dealing with important things. This means heuristic works most of time. I recently realised that heuristic and optimization sometimes indicate the same point. I was playing a strategy game and I made a lot of calculation to plan how to proceed. However, after all I arrive a conclusion which heuristic approach immediately tells. This was the moment that I realised the importance of heuristics and KISS(Keep it Simple and Stupid) principle. Over-optimization appears when we move away from simplicity and heuristics. Therefore, I think we shouldn&#8217;tÂ underrate simplicity and heuristics. We need these things when we are dealing with optimization.
