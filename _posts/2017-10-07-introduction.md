  Hi there. While there are a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blog</a>s, I have decided to create my own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blog</a>. Why? Because I realised that I have some ideas to tell you about. In this blog, sometimes we will go deep into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">philosophy</a>. Sometimes, we will walk through some topics related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">Computer Science</a>. And sometimes I will try to answer questions coming from you guys. For the cases ofÂ slip of the tongue, please forgive me in advance.

  I am hoping and willing to get a lot of comments. Don&#8217;t kill me with your silence. ðŸ˜‰

  OK. Fasten your seat belts and we are starting&#8230;
