  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(software_engineering)"><strong>Layers of Abstraction</strong></a> is one of most important principles in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering">Software Engineering</a>. It simply means every part of the program does its job without knowing details of other parts of the program. This simple principle makes it easy to design and develop big programs.

  Moreover, it seems like this principle not only applies for software engineering but also applies for our lives and even for other scientific fields. A few hours ago I was thinking about rainy and cloudy weather of Istanbul because my father had a flight and I was a little bit worried. Then, I realized that I was not the one who should think about weather. The pilot and the air traffic controller were the responsible people about this topic. Since there are other people taking care of the condition, I continued on my job(studying). In this case, I was abstracted from the topic and I could focus on my job. Similarly, we don&#8217;t think about details of how our houses built or how our PCs manufactured, we just use them. If we were thinking about them, we couldn&#8217;t do our jobs. This simple principle makes us efficient in our jobs.

  Furthermore, when we look at science, we see that there are a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling">models</a>. Actually, science is built upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling">models</a> and scientist is the one who understands and develops new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling">models</a> using experimental data. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_modelling">Model</a> is something that includes and focuses on only a few aspects of reality to inspect those aspects. So, modelling in science is the analog of layers of abstraction principle. Most of the time, we as human beings try to simplify problems and solve simple problems because our brains work more efficient this way.

  In this writing, I mentioned one way of simplification which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer">Layer of Abstraction(Abstraction layer)</a>. Another simplification method I know is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm">Divide and Conquer</a>. I may mention that topic in next writing.
