   I am an undergraduate <a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/">Computer Engineering</a> student at <a href="http://www.boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index">Boğaziçi University</a>. (Expected Graduation: 2020)

  I am passioned about Artificial Intelligence research towards Singularity. I am planning to work on this passion as a professional researcher for the rest of my life. This is a multidisciplinary goal such that it involves Neuroscience (low level), Cognitive Science (high level), Machine Learning&Statistics (practical level) and also a lot of Mathematics (tool of modeling).
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  I try to understand and use every possible perspective about the Artificial Intelligence research. I have taken courses about Machine Learning & Neuroscience. From the insight I have gained so far, I am mostly interested in online, distributed unsupervised & reinforcement machine learning methods.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Furthermore, I also find Causal Inference related. According to Judea Pearl, a researcher working on Causal Models, most of the state-of-art work in Machine Learning done at the first level of Causality (associational level) and I agree with him. I think ideas from Causality should be placed into Machine Learning research.

  My a fan of Geoffrey Hinton, one of the leading researchers in Machine Learning, and I want to be like him because he seems to be very insightful researcher according to me. I guest his multidisciplinary experience helps him. I follow his work and I found his work about Capsule Networks interesting.

  Up to the summer of 2018, my research was just reading papers. However, I started working under supervision of A. Taylan Cemgil, a researcher and lecturer at Boğaziçi Uni. who is interested in various topics, at summer 2018. He showed me his interesting works about Bayesian Statistics & Applied Mathematics. Our research team is currently working on Word Embedding.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  I recently started thinking that Embedding & Representational Learning as the first topic we should consider as I saw a presentation of Hinton about Thought Vectors, which is like the inside-brain representations of things. I planned to work on Shared Representation Embedding, finding dense vector representations of different objects(alphabet, words, sentences, images etc.) in a one single vector space.

  Lastly, I am also a self-taught Software Developer with years of experience.
